# Fract-ol
One of the first graphical projects at 42 school, fract-ol generates beautiful fractals from the complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.

# Status

Finished: 2023-01-08. Grade: 125/100.

# Usage

---

Note that this project was tested on Linux only. It may run on MacOS with small adjustments to the Makefile, as described in hsmits and jvan-sni's [42 Docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html).

---

You will now be in the correct directory for compilation. Compile with ```make```. Fract-ol should now be ready!

## Executing Fract-ol

At execution time, you must specify a fractal to display. You may also provide other optional parameters:

```shell
./fractol <name> <complex number>
```
